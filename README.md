 Explainable-credit-scorecard
Traditional credit ratings are slow, opaque, and often miss fast-changing market signals, creating inefficiencies and risks. Our project, Explainable Credit Scorecard, uses AI and explainable ML to deliver a real-time, transparent, and analyst-friendly credit intelligence platform.
Explainable Credit Scorecard

 🚀 Overview
Traditional credit rating agencies update infrequently and rely on opaque methodologies.  
This creates **mispricing opportunities** and exposes investors to hidden risks.  

We propose an **AI/ML-powered Explainable Credit Intelligence Platform** that:
- Continuously ingests structured + unstructured financial data
- Generates **real-time creditworthiness scores**
- Provides **transparent feature-level explanations**
- Visualizes results via an **interactive dashboard**


 🏗 System Architecture
![System Architecture](docs/architecture.png)

Components:
1. Data Ingestion
   - Structured: Yahoo Finance API, Alpha Vantage (financial ratios, stock data)
   - Unstructured: News headlines, press releases (NLP sentiment)
   - (Demo uses toy dataset as proof of concept)

2. Scoring Engine
   - Prototype: Decision Tree Classifier
   - Output: Credit Risk Score (0–100 scale)
   - Incremental retraining planned for future

3. Explainability Layer
   - Feature importance with SHAP
   - Plain-language explanations (e.g., "High debt ratio → higher risk")

4. Analyst Dashboard
   - Built with Streamlit
   - Shows credit scores, feature contributions, and event-driven explanations


🛠 Tech Stack
- Python(pandas, scikit-learn, shap, matplotlib)
- Streamlit (dashboard)
- Docker (for reproducibility – future work)



 📊 Features Implemented
- ✅ Basic model training (Decision Tree)
- ✅ SHAP-based explainability
- ✅ Interactive dashboard prototype
- ✅ Demo credit score output with feature drivers
- 🔜 Real-time ingestion of finance + news data
- 🔜 Automated retraining & MLOps integration

---

⚖ Trade-offs & Future Work
- Current version: toy dataset for demonstration
- Future integrations:
  - Real-world financial datasets (SEC, MCA, Yahoo Finance)
  - Unstructured news sentiment (NLP pipeline)
  - Incremental learning for real-time updates
  - Alerts for sudden score changes
